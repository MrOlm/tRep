# tRep
Some scripts to help you get the taxonomy of a genome

### OVERVIEW
This program is a collection of tools for determining the taxonomy of a genome using a number of different tools. Its pretty unorgaized at the moment, but might develop into something at some point.

### Dependencies

dRep (https://github.com/MrOlm/drep)

ETE3 (https://github.com/etetoolkit/ete)

## Data preparation

At the heart of much of tRep's functionality is the so-called b6+ file. This file is the result of performing an amino acid search of the sequences you're interested in against the UniRef100 database.There are two ways of making this file, but neither of them are easy at this point.

### Annotation using usearch
If you're in the Banfield lab, you make these during the standard processing pipeline using usearch, with a command that looks like:

```
/opt/bin/bio/usearch64 -ublast ${file} -db /data1/blastdb/uniref/uniprot_cp.fasta.udb -maxhits 1 -evalue 0.0001 -threads 48 -blast6out ${file}.b6.fix

ruby /home/bcthomas/work/pipeline_dev/fix_usearch_output.rb ${file}.b6.fix > $file.b6

annolookup.py ${file}.b6 uniprot > $file.b6+
```

However, this requires 64bit usearch because the database is so large (which costs lots of money) and the script annolookup.py to translate from UniRef100 ID to NCBI TaxID (but the script relies on a special server, Hydra, which is not public). In the end you get a b6+ file that looks like:

```

```

### Annotation using diamond

A free alternative to usearch is the program Diamond. A way of avoiding a special server to translate between UniRef100 and NCBI TaxIDs is to simply put the TaxID in the diamond database (an idea I borrowed from the program Tango (https://github.com/NBISweden/tango)). This means you can then download this special diamond database, search against it, and immediately have a b6+ file.

If you're in the Sonnenburg lab, this special database is located at `/LAB_DATA/DATABASES/UniRef100/uniref100.translated.diamond.dmnd`, and has a companion table of annotations at `/LAB_DATA/DATABASES/UniRef100/uniref100.ttable`. The entries in this database look like:

`>Q6GZX2_2219561_10492`

The first part is the UniRef100 ID; the second part is the taxID of the representative organism of the cluster (based on the file `ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/idmapping/idmapping_selected.tab.gz`); the third part is the taxID of the UniRef100 cluster as a whole (based on the original fasta header description).

If you're not in the Sonnenburg lab and are interested in using this tool, drop me a line. I'm happy to share this database, but because it is ~80Gb, I can't think of an easy way to share it publicly. You can also recreate this yourself if you'd like using the format described above.

You can then search against this database using a command like:

```
diamond blastp -d  /LAB_DATA/DATABASES/UniRef100/uniref100.translated.diamond.dmnd -p 6 -q ${file} -o ${file}.diamondOut -f 6 -e 0.0001 -k 1
```

Which will make a b6+ file that looks like:

```

```

Where the first column is the query sequence and the second column is the modified header with taxID information.

** Yes, I know both of these files look nothing alike, and its silly that I'm calling them both b6+ files, but tRep is able to parse them both just fine if you use them when it asks for a b6+ file **

## make_Tdb.py

This program makes a Tdb.csv file from a b6+ file resulting from an assembly. A Tdb.csv file contains lots of taxonomy information that can then be used by other aspects of the program to actually get the taxonomy that you want. A Tdb.csv file looks like this:

## quickTaxonomy_centrifuge.py

This program takes a genome bin, calls genes with prodigal, assigns those genes to an organism in a centrifuge database, and uses that information to determine the taxonomy of the bin.

The way that this functions is by mapping the nucleotide sequence of genes to a reference database. Thus, this doesn't work very well for novel organisms that aren't in the centrifuge database provided.

This program provides just a guess as to what the organism is, assuming that it is indeed in the reference database. That said, if an organism of the same species is in the centrifuge database, it works pretty well.
